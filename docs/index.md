# Git Patchdance

**An interactive terminal and GUI tool for advanced git patch management**

## Overview

Git Patchdance is a powerful tool that provides an intuitive interface for moving patches and partial patches between commits, creating new commits from selected changes, and performing complex git history manipulations with confidence.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Patch Management**: Move individual patches or parts of patches between commits
- **Terminal Interface**: Modern async terminal UI using Textual
- **Safe Operations**: Preview changes before applying, with undo functionality
- **Flexible Workflows**: Support for complex git history restructuring
- **Visual Diff Viewer**: Syntax-highlighted patch viewing and editing

## Use Cases

### Reorganizing Commits
Split large commits into focused, atomic changes by moving specific patches to new commits.

### Fixing Commit History
Move bug fixes or improvements to their logical location in the commit history.

### Cherry-Picking Enhancements
Selectively apply parts of commits across branches with fine-grained control.

### Code Review Preparation
Clean up commit history to create clear, reviewable changesets.

## Architecture

Git Patchdance is built in Python for ease of development and extensibility, using:

- **Textual** for modern terminal user interface
- **GitPython** for robust git operations
- **asyncio** for async operations
- **Click** for command-line interface
